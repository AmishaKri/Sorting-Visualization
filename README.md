# Sorting Visualizer

This Sorting Visualizer is a web application that allows you to visualize the sorting process of various algorithms. The implemented algorithms include Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Heap Sort.

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualization:** You can observe how each sorting algorithm organizes a given array step by step. The visualization provides a better understanding of how these algorithms work.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** The visualizer supports several commonly used sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Heap Sort. This variety allows you to compare their performance and efficiency.
- **Change Array Size:** The application offers the flexibility to adjust the size of the array being sorted. You can choose a smaller or larger array size to see how the algorithms behave with different inputs.
